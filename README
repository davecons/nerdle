Currently, there is one significant bug and one improvement that I need attention.
The bug is that if a tile is black but that same character is previously not black,
the code can hang. For example, if you guess 6*6*1=36 and the first 6 is green
but the next two are black, the code doesn't play nice with it.

The improvement is that currently the code just guesses a random plausible option
at every turn. It should guess a random plausible option with the maximum number
of different characters in it.
